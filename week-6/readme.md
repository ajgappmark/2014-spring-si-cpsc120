## Instructions

- Once again, today's exercise is also today's lab.  Please make sure to let
  the professor see your code before you submit it, so he can check you off.

- For each of the files, before turning it in, make sure to add a comment at
  the top containing

  0. Your name
  0. The week ("week 6" today)
  0. The name of the program (the same as the filename, except without the
     ".cpp" at the end)



## Exercise

### Setup

TODO: create ... files, named ..., for use in each subsection below


### Review: Boolean Expressions

TODO


### Warm-up: Broken Code

TODO


### Predefined Functions (a.k.a Library Functions)

TODO: like pow() :)


### User Defined Functions

TODO: like implementing abs() (with conditionals!)

TODO: probably abstracting what they did with the calculator program the week
before, making functions for each operation, rather than performing it in place



## Challenge
