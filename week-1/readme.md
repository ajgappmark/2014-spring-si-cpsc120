# Spring 2014 - CPSC 120 - SI -- Week 1

Just as a record of what we talked about during SI and Lab:
- Stages of compilation
- Creating a project in Microsoft Visual Studio
- Compiling and running a project in Visual Studio
- How to save/export/find source files that are part of a project in Visual
  Studio, and upload them to Titanium

We also touched on:
- A few errors that occur pretty commonly:
    - Missing semicolons at the end of statements
    - Missing the `using namespace std;` line after `#include <iostream>`

I also wanted to encourage you guys:
- Errors from the compiler are not bad!  I still get a bunch nearly every time
  I program in C++ or C.  Eventually, you learn what causes most of them, and
  you're able to fix those pretty quickly.
- It **will** get easier.  Promise.  The students I helped with last semester
  almost surprised me with how far they came in only 15 weeks.  That said, just
  like any complex task, [it takes a long time to learn how to program]
  (http://norvig.com/21-days.html).  But it's worth it.  Not only for the fun
  of learning how to make a computer do your work for you :) but also because
  it forces you to learn new ways of thinking.
- Google is your friend.  Really.  Especially when it leads you to
  [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com) or [Stack Overflow]
  (http://stackoverflow.com).
