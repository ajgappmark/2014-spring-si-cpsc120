# TODO

## Week 1
- Since this is a 100 level course, maybe it's okay to have week-1 as an intro
  to everything, without a whole bunch of content, to give people a second to
  settle in (I know I used to appreciate that).  That said, if people were
  willing, it might be better to just jump straight into the lab we have here
  for week-2, and save a bit of time :) .

## Week 2
- Using makefiles (and shell scripts...) was probably unnecessary.  It would
  probably be better to go straight to compiling on the command line, as
  week-3's lab does.

## Week 5
- In the challenge: exponentiation requires either loops or `pow()` (from
  `<cmath>`), neither of which we've gone over yet.  But, one student noticed
  this (without any prompting) and another was able to look up `pow()` very
  quickly once I told him it existed, so maybe it's okay :) .


# Thoughts

## Week 5
- This is the first week where things are more of an experiment than a
  tutorial.  Yay!
- It's also the first week that this exercise is being used as the lab (to turn
  in).  I think it worked pretty well :) (I'm proud of it at least).
- It's also the first week of using a roster to check off everyone who
  completed the assignment (which I think was better, not just for being
  easier? but also because it made an opportunity for immediate feedback).
- I'm still meaning to get people drawing on the board eventually, and to get
  them searching for their own stuff online (since that's a really valuable
  skill).
- Everybody finished before lab was over!  A few came close to taking longer,
  but I saw nothing there to be worried about, and this is really encouraging
  :) .
