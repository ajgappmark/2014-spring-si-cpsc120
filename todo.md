A place for thoughts and possible revisions.

**If you're a student** and you're reading this, and you have anything to add
(comments, complaints, or anything) please let me know!  Maybe email me :) .


## Week 1
- Since this is a 100 level course, maybe it's okay to have week-1 as an intro
  to everything, without a whole bunch of content, to give people a second to
  settle in (I know I used to appreciate that).  That said, if people were
  willing, it might be better to just jump straight into the lab we have here
  for week-2, and save a bit of time :) .

## Week 2
- Using makefiles (and shell scripts...) was probably unnecessary.  It would
  probably be better to go straight to compiling on the command line, as
  week-3's lab does.

## Week 5
- In the challenge: exponentiation requires either loops or `pow()` (from
  `<cmath>`), neither of which we've gone over yet.  But, one student noticed
  this (without any prompting) and another was able to look up `pow()` very
  quickly once I told him it existed, so maybe it's okay :) .
- This is the first week where things are more of an experiment than a
  tutorial.  Yay!
- It's also the first week that this exercise is being used as the lab (to turn
  in).  I think it worked pretty well :) (I'm proud of it at least).
- It's also the first week of using a roster to check off everyone who
  completed the assignment (which I think was better, not just for being
  easier? but also because it made an opportunity for immediate feedback).
- I'm still meaning to get people drawing on the board eventually, and to get
  them searching for their own stuff online (since that's a really valuable
  skill).
- Everybody finished before lab was over!  A few came close to taking longer,
  but I saw nothing there to be worried about, and this is really encouraging
  :) .
- By far the most common error I saw was to use a `+` instead of a `'+'` when
  testing for which operator was entered by the user in the calculator program.

## Week 6
- Needs to be organized more simply, and probably a bit easier.
- Should have spent more time on Boolean stuff earlier (that's okay... we'll
  work on it next week :) ).
    - A lot of people had a real conceptual problem with the idea of `if (i)
      ...` (for some `int` called `i`) in part 2 of "Review: Boolean
      Expressions".
    - A few people (at least) weren't able to fix all the errors in "Warm-up:
      Broken Code".  Didn't have time to see what all of their questions
      were...  I did see a few people having a problem understanding the error
      in `if (choice == 'y' || 'Y') ...`.
    - The instructions for "Predefined Functions (a.k.a. Library Functions)"
      might not have been clear enough.  Not sure how they could be improved at
      the moment though...
- Almost no one got to "Preview: User Defined Functions".  I think the concepts
  that were there might just be rolled into Week 8's lab, or whenever it's
  convenient.
- It seems like people tend to read the exercise and write the program in
  tandem with each other (instead of reading the whole subsection and then
  writing the program).  This is not a bad thing...  It does mean that in the
  future I should probably put anything I wish everyone to see (like "Sample
  runs") at the beginning.

## Week 7
- I think spending a whole lecture and lab going over booleans was really good.
  It was an easier lab.  The faster students finished *really* fast, and a few
  took the whole time.  Myprogramming lab seems to be quite good for this
  topic.  Also, the truth table worksheet was nice, because it helped to make
  apparent some of the misconceptions people had (even some of the faster
  students) :) .

## Week 8
- This one went both better and worse than I had imagined.  A few people came
  up with a solution *very* quickly.  That was pretty cool.  On the other hand,
  a few people didn't quite understand within the lab period.  Mostly because
  they didn't design (in groups) first, like the prompt said to, I imagine..
  Mostly because that's probably a bit awkward, and I failed to properly
  encourage it.
- I probably should have stopped around 30-45 minutes in, and called a group
  design session in the front, so I could help everyone who hadn't gotten it by
  themselves yet.  Alternately, we could have required them to turn in a
  "structure chart" (i.e. a design picture), or something like that.
- It was cool to see the different ideas people came up with :) .  I remember
  3, besides mine, distinctly (and actually, the solution I had come up with
  was in the minority).  The majority of people I saw implemented it with
  multiple while loops -- one for each case (so, one for pulling out all the
  "M"s, then all the "CM"s, etc.).
- There were quite a few students that looked up an algorithm online.
  Perfectly acceptable, I think, according to what we've been allowing (and
  sometimes advocating, about looking stuff up) in the past.  But still, half
  the point was algorithm design, and so it would have been better if everyone
  had done it on their own.  Probably, finding some way to get them all to
  design it on paper (or on the whiteboard! preferably) would help a lot with
  that.

## Week 9
- Took a lot longer than I thought it would, but not too long, and I think it
  went really well :)
- A lot of people misinterpreted the assignment at first...  Many tried to use
  a loop around a cout statement that printed the diamond literally.  Quite a
  few also thought that they were supposed to use a loop to print the diamond
  three times *for each type of loop* (separating the different types of loops
  into different files).
- Everyone was really shy about coming to the board, lol.  But when I kept
  prodding, eventually a small group came up, and we designed it, and it went
  really well.  After that, I erased our work, on purpose -- and within a few
  minutes most of the rest of the class came up, and we went through the
  process again (except that many of them were more shy than the first group,
  understandably).
- The ideas behind this assignment -- that you can make one variable be
  essentially the reverse of another (decrementing as the other increments, for
  example), and that you can shift the point at which a variable is zero,
  within loops -- seemed new for almost the entire class.  But that was mostly
  intentional :) -- they weren't intended to get it on their own, only to
  participate in the design process, and to see how much easier it is to
  code once you have your main ideas figured out.
- Once we had designed the loops, almost none of them had problems deciding
  where to `cout << " ";` or `cout << "* ";`, etc.
- Also, there were only a few people that I saw having minor problems
  converting between the different types of loops -- and I'm pretty sure
  everyone would have gotten that eventually, in groups, without undue
  difficulty.  I think mostly, it was just them being unfamiliar with the
  syntax, since it's still a bit new.
