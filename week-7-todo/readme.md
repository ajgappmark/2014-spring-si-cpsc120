## Instructions

TODO:
- Next class is going to be
    - briefly switch statements
    - boolean review
    - boolean worksheet
- Next lab is going to be myprogramminglab for
    - booleans
    - if/else statements
    - switch statements

- I said I'd write a boolean worksheet for during class



## Continuing Challenges

- [Learn how to use Git](http://git-scm.com/documentation)

- Lean how to use Vim (type `vimtutor` into the terminal, and follow the
  instructions)

- [Learn Python](http://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/)

- Learn [one of the languages on codecademy] (http://www.codecademy.com)
    - Especially Python, Ruby, or JavaScript

- Write a [bash script](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) (or an [expect
  script](http://w2home.blogspot.com/2007/11/expect-tutorial.html) if you're
  feeling *super* ambitious) (or an [applescript
  script](http://macosxautomation.com/applescript/firsttutorial/index.html) if
  you like) to automate the testing of the code in this project for you.
    - There may be better tutorials for expect and applescript; I have a lot of
      experience with the page linked above for bash scripting though, and IMO
      it's really good.
    - Necessarily, this is a Linux / Mac / Cygwin (on Windows) only challenge.
