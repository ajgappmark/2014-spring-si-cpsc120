## Instructions

This lab is intended to be relatively short (so that we have extra time for
anyone who wants to stay and ask questions about the midterm), but it's a
little different:
- **Without looking it up online,** design this first, on the board, and show
  the professor or myself so you can get checked off.  You are encouraged to do
  this in groups :) .  Don't feel bad asking for hints.
- Write up your code individually, and submit the .cpp file on Titanium.

Without using any conditionals, write a program that prints the following shape
three times
```
      *
    * * *
  * * * * *
* * * * * * *
  * * * * *
    * * *
      *
```
with at most one extra leading and trailing space (if you need them).
- For the first time, use exactly 3 for loops (in some configuration)
- For the second time, use exactly 3 while loops (in some configuration)
- For the third time, use exactly 3 do-while loops (in some configuration)

The point is to compare the different types of loops, and to solve the problem
together before writing the code :)

Once you finish, you are free to leave, or to study in groups for the midterm.
You may wish to review old labs and such, to help you remember any questions
you may have had.  Now is the best time to ask before the test!



## Continuing Challenges

- [Learn how to use Git](http://git-scm.com/documentation)

- Lean how to use Vim (type `vimtutor` into the terminal, and follow the
  instructions)

- [Learn Python](http://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/)

- Learn [one of the languages on codecademy] (http://www.codecademy.com)
    - Especially Python, Ruby, or JavaScript

- Write a [bash script](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) (or an [expect
  script](http://w2home.blogspot.com/2007/11/expect-tutorial.html) if you're
  feeling *super* ambitious) (or an [applescript
  script](http://macosxautomation.com/applescript/firsttutorial/index.html) if
  you like) to automate the testing of the code in this project for you.
    - There may be better tutorials for expect and applescript; I have a lot of
      experience with the page linked above for bash scripting though, and IMO
      it's really good.
    - Necessarily, this is a Linux / Mac / Cygwin (on Windows) only challenge.
