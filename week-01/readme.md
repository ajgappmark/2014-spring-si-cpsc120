# Week 1

Just as a record of what we talked about during SI and Lab:
- Stages of compilation
- Creating a project in Microsoft Visual Studio
- Compiling and running a project in Visual Studio
- How to save/export/find source files that are part of a project in Visual
  Studio, and upload them to Titanium

We also touched on:
- A few errors that occur pretty commonly:
    - Missing semicolons at the end of statements
    - Missing the `using namespace std;` line after `#include <iostream>`

I also wanted to encourage you guys:
- Errors from the compiler are not bad!  I still get a bunch nearly every time
  I program in C++ or C.  Eventually, you learn what causes most of them, and
  you're able to fix those pretty quickly.
- It **will** get easier.  Promise.  By the end of the semester you'll be
  surprised.  Of course, just like any complex task, [it takes a long time to
  learn how to program well] (http://norvig.com/21-days.html).  But it's worth
  it, not only for the fun of learning how to make a computer do your work for
  you :) but also because it will teach you new ways of thinking that apply to
  far more than just computers.  And even if you're only here for a semester, I
  think you'll learn some valuable skills, and be exposed to some interesting
  tools.
- Google is your friend.  Really.  Especially when it leads you to
  [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com) or [Stack Overflow]
  (http://stackoverflow.com).
