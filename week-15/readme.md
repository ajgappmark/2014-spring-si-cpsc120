# Week 15

## Project (week 2 of 2)

**This project has been shortened to two weeks only, because of how the labs are scheduled.**

Please see the (very slightly) revised [prompt from last week](../week-14).

Also, I hope that if you finish early, you might try out some of the challenges
in the "Preview" section :) or have fun implementing your own improvements to
the basic maze -- just for fun :)

I've also posted a folder of [extra](../extra) stuff -- the project that was
going to be project-4 (the "num2word" project), along with a solution, and also
the solution to another project idea (the "magic-number" project) that I didn't
end up writing a prompt for.  The "num2word" project would have been really
fun, I think, and you might want to read through at least the solution, just
for fun :) .  The "magic-number" project would have been really fun as well,
and very closely based on the "num2word" project -- but I was having too much
fun when I wrote my solution, and it's a little advanced -- if you're up for a
challenge, it might be fun to look over too.

I've also try to get some worksheets up, as soon as I have time, in case anyone
wants something extra to help review.
